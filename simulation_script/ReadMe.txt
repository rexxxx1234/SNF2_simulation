 butterfly_1.csv and butterfly_2.csv are the original butterfly datasets. They contain the same set of ~800 butterflies, with associated feature vectors.

butterfly_labels.csv are the associated butterfly labels in butterfly_1.csv and butterfly_2.csv

createNets.py  added new “simulated” butterflies to both of these datasets with some Gaussian noise and the resulting datasets are in X1.csv and X2.csv
